# Advent of Code 2025

I am working the Advent of Code 2024 in Python for my own learning.
I'm just gonna improv this since I've not done a python-based Advent of Code in a long time, but I'm now
using python daily, so I should use it to get better with the language.

I may be blogging some days at [my blog](https://ddellspe.net) so feel free to subscribe/follow for
your own fun.
